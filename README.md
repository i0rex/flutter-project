This project was developed as part of my studies and is built using Flutter. The app provides a platform for local farmers and traders to showcase their products, allowing customers to search for offerings based on location and rate their experiences.

Firebase was utilized for both the database and geolocation services, ensuring seamless data management and location-based functionality. The project aims to support local businesses and improve customer accessibility to fresh, locally-sourced products.
